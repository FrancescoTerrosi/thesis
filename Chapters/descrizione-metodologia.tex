\chapter{System Analysis Method}

\section{Introduction and Preliminaries}

The goal of this study is to develop a first experimental methodology intended to observe emergence-related aspects coming from the interaction of a Control System and a System Supervisor, analyzing the system in a \textsl{simulated} environment.\newline
The software architecture of an AV was simplified in two main components:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A \textsl{Controller}: a Neural Network trained with \textsl{reinforcement learning} algorithms to drive the car, reading ground-truth values from cameras
	\item A \textsl{Safety Monitor} that checks whether the car is going too fast towards an object, processing data received from a LiDAR sensor, and if that's so, apply an emergency-brake
\end{itemize}

This work focuses on exploring the topic from a different point of view and to assess its feasibility in an experimental, simulated environment. Due to the system being composed by two constituent systems: the Controller and the Monitor, we think that a point of view based on the emergent behaviour resulting from the interaction of these systems can improve the quality of the assessment.

In this chapter is presented and discussed a method to study the safety level of an autonomous car over time, observing the emergence resulting from the interactions of a neural network controller and a safety monitor in a simulated environment.

The proposed framework is designed with particular attention on studying the emergence resulting from the interaction of these two consitutent systems.

The main aspects we are interested in this first stage of exploration are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item How the effectiveness of a monitor evolves when the neural network is learning
	\item Effects of training strategies on the effectiveness of a safety monitor
\end{itemize}

One of the most appealing features of neural networks is that they can be \textsl{trained} on data sets to improve their performance. One stage of training is done by collecting data over \textsl{n} steps and updating the weights of the prediction function. The weights of the function after $i$ training stages represents the \textsl{state} of the network at \textbf{epoch i}.\newline
A neural network will likely give good results after "enough" epochs. The harder the task, the more epochs are needed. Driving a car is a quite hard task and it's inimmaginable to save the weights of each epoch. Therefore, given a neural network N, we define a \textbf{checkpoint} as a generic epoch of N. Say we trained N for 500 epochs. If we save the weights of the prediction function every 100 epochs, we will end up with 5 checkpoints:

\begin{center}
	$checkpoint_{1}\: <\: checkpoint_{2}\: <\: \dots \:<\: checkpoint_{5}$,
\end{center}

where $checkpoint_{1}$ helds the network's weights at epoch 100, $checkpoint_{2}$ at epoch 200 and so on.\newline

Let's now consider a self-driving car that is being tested on the road (either real, or simulated). Its task is to ride the car the longest possible, without crashing. During the ride, the environment surrounding the car will change as the car procedes in its run. It may happen that in some of the system's state, the probability of a subsequent crash becomes very high (e.g. a pedestrian suddenly cross the street) if and only if the action taken by the Controller would result in the pedestrian getting hit we will address it as a failure (of the controller). The same reasoning applies if the pedestrian is actually detected, and the car hits something else while trying to avoid it:

\begin{itemize}
	\item If the Controller takes \textsl{any} action that would result in a crash, it's considered failed
	\item If an hazardous event happens, i.e. a situation in which the probability of observing a crash is higher than usual, the Controller is considered failed if and only if its actions will not avoid the imminent failure
\end{itemize}

In this sense, at this stage of knowledge, we don't distinguish between changes in the environment that raises the probability of a crash (e.g. a pedestrian crossing the street) and hazardous actions take by the Controller (e.g. a sudden steer towards a wall).

If the controller fails in the way just described, it's the Monitor's duty to run a safety-routine in order to prevent the imminent failure.\newline

In the case of a failure of the Controller, the Monitor not only needs to detect whether it failed or not, but it also must run a safety-routine to prevent a failure of the whole system. In this first phase of analysis, we consider the action taken by the Monitor to be always safe. This means that:

\begin{itemize}
	\item If the Monitor executes \textbf{all} the steps in the safety-routine, the system will be in a safe-state.
	\item A failure of the Safety Monitor may be one of the following:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[1)] The obstacle is not detected
		\item[2)] The obstacle is detected but the routine fails to terminate its execution (i.e. the detection was too late)
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

We consider the system failed if and only if both the Controller and the Safety-Monitor failed, as described above, leading to a crash.

At the system level, we are interested in observing the probability of having a failure (crash) and how to minimize it. At the same time we want to observe how the effectiveness of the Safety Monitor changes when the Controller is trained over time.

In order to achieve this, $c$ checkpoints are saved for later testing and comparison. This is useful not only for checking that the network is improving during the training, but also to have a better understanding on how useful is the Monitor when the Controller becomes more and more expert. This is mandatory for the experimental activity as different checkpoints of the same network are tested under the same condition, to observe how the behaviour of the Controller changes in the first stages of the training.

The need for multiple checkpoints is mandatory not only to test that the network is improving, but also to observe how the monitor's effectiveness change over time. Moreover, if many checkpoints of the same network are tested under the same scenarios, it is possible to extract interesting measures, as we'll see in the next section.

Before the analysis can start, $n_{h}$ scenarios must be defined. A \textsl{Scenario} is a set of initial conditions (e.g. the spawn point of the car, seeds used in random number generators$\dots$) in which the car is intended to be tested. The pedix $h$ represents the difficulty level for the specific case. The purpose of this is that we are interested in testing the car under the same initial condition but for one factor, in order to have a better understanding on what makes the system fail more often. The $h$ variations should be developed with growing difficulty and at the same time they must be realistic. Given a Scenario $S$, examples of variations may be: to increase the number of cars in the scenario, or to simulate adversal weather conditions. A combination of these 2 variations should result in a \textsl{harder} variation of the scenario\footnote{It is important to point that what we think to be "harder", may in reality be easier to handle for the car.}. It's important to keep in mind that these scenarios, once defined, should not be changed as they will be used for testing all the checkpoints. A change in the settings of a scenario (except for variations) should be considered as a new one.

We hope that the results collected here will help in the process of understanding what makes a situation \textsl{"harder"} than others for such systems.

\section{Experimental Method}

The approach used for this exploratory work is divided in 3 phases:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Phase 1: Given $c$ checkpoints of a neural network and $n_{h}$ scenarios, the Controller and the Safety Monitor are tested
	\item Phase 2: The network is retrained from the last checkpoint recorded, using different strategies to improve its performances. The new networks obtained and the (same) Safety Monitor are then retested in all the $n_{h}$ scenarios
	\item Phase 3: Data Analysis and Comparison
\end{itemize}


In the first phase we are interested in assessing the goodness of the neural network and of the Monitor. This is done in 2 different steps. 

In the first step, the $c$ checkpoints of the Controller are tested in all the scenarios. In this step we are mostly interested in observing how the \textsl{Reliability} of the Controller changes with respect to these checkpoints.

One of the main problems when testing a neural network is that of \textsl{repeatability}. It is very unlikely that the \textbf{same} neural network, under the \textbf{same} initial conditions, will behave in the same manner in multiple runs. Due to this property of networks, it may happen that the failure mode observed in one of the runs of the scenario $s_{i}$ will never happen again, or the time needed to make it happen again may be very long.
How the scenarios and their variations are created is fundamental to observe specific failures, however it's impossible to think to \textsl{all} the possible failure situations that may happen, for this reason we think that the scenario-variation approach may help in solving this issue, creating harder operational situations in which the factors that lead to a crash may be studied.

The repeatibility issue was solved by creating a \textsl{black box} for each run of the scenarios developed for testing. This approach is used to keep a trace of the Controller's actions, so that the specific run may be studied more fully to understand what made tha Controller fail. These data can be then used to better study what hazardous situations are covered by the Controller at a specific checkpoint $j$, and if these situations are still covered when the network is tested at the checkpoint $j+x$.\newline


\subsection{Controller Testing}

The Controller is tested in isolation in each scenario, for each difficulty level, until a crash occurs. The situation in which no failure is recorded is still a possibility (even if the difficulty level somehow mitigates this issue). A reasonable alting criteria is out of the scope of this work and is still a problem in the academic community, however, as noted in the previous section, this problem may be solved.\cite{zhaoStrigini}

The reasoning behind the choice of isolating the in order to test it Controller, comes from some of the problems issued during the method development phase.
The main problems are the \textsl{repeatibility} and \textsl{non-intrusiveness}. As pointed before, the \textsl{repeatibility} issue for the neural network is solved by creating a \textsl{black box} containing informations about the car's state in each frame. At the same time we can not think about testing the whole system at once (Controller \textsl{and} Monitor) because a safety-brake executed by the monitor will most likely change the environmental conditions for the rest of the simulation and we would not be able to compute measures about the goodness of the Controller itself. Testing the Controller in isolation helps to solve these issues and it's preparatory to the second phase.

Recording the actions taken by the Controller for \textsl{each} frame (as well as other measures such as the vehicle's speed in that frame) make it possible to have a great control over the data, as a single run may be repeated many times to gather additional data if needed.

When measuring the reliability function $R(t)$ of a system, one of the main measure of interest is its Mean Time To Failure, because it is easy to compute in simulated environments, and it's the starting point to derive other metrics.
In the Automotive Sector however, data are usually computed with respect to the travelled distance, i.e. Mean Distance to Failure, rate of crashes per kilometers, and so on.
With our approach, if the simulated environment and the hardware running the simulations are powerful enough to run the simulations at a fixed time-step, it's very easy to switch the point of view on the data.

As long as the neural network is trained properly, we expect the following disequation to hold: $R_{i}(t)\: < \: R_{j}(t)$, where $i$ and $j$ are 2 checkpoints, with $i\: <\: j$. This can be easily verified using the approach defined above to collect the data.

When the controller has been tested for each difficulty, in all the scenarios at least the followings must be computed:

\begin{itemize}
	\item $MDBF_{i,j} = \frac{\#\: of\: faults}{meters\: travelled}$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[-] Mean Distance Between Failure for the $i^{th}$ checkpoint, at the $j^{th}$ level of difficulty
	\end{itemize}
	\item $MTBF_{i,j}\: =\: \frac{\#\: of\: faults}{operational\: time}$
		\begin{itemize}
		\item[-] Mean Time Between Failure for the $i^{th}$ checkpoint, at the $j^{th}$ level of difficulty
	\end{itemize}
	\item $FR_{i,j}\: =\: \frac{1}{MTBF_{i,j}}$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Failure Rate of the $i^{th}$ checkpoint at the $j^{th}$ level of difficulty
	\end{itemize}
	\item $R_{i,j}(t)\: =\: 1 - e^{-FR_{i,j}\cdot t}$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Reliability Function of the $i^{th}$ checkpoint at the $j^{th}$ level of difficulty, i.e. the probability that the Controller $C_{i}$ is not failed at time $t$ when operating at difficult $j$
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{itemize}

\newpage

If the Simulator used for testing permits it, other data should be recorded too, in order to enhance the comprehension of the Controller's behaviour, such as:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The car's instantaneous speed and acceleration vector at each frame
	\item With \textsl{what} the car crashed (e.g. a vehicle, a pedestrian, a generic obstacle$\dots$)
	\item Environmental conditions at time $t-x$, if a crash occurred at time $t$
\end{itemize}

These data are fundamental to distinguish between \textsl{"safe"} and \textsl{"catastrophic"} failures. For example, if a fence is hit at a speed, let's say, less than 10km/h, it may be flagged as a less serious crash than hitting a pedestrian at the same speed.

As the Controller learns, we expect the \textsl{Reliability Function} and the \textsl{MTBF/MDBF} to increase. If the \textsl{black box} makes use of enhanced data (such as the ones listed above), it is also possible to observe changes in the car's behaviour with respect to the scenario and the difficulty level. For example: if we define a difficulty $k$ by doubling the number of cars in the scenarios, it may happen that it is observed an increasement on the amount of collisions against other obstacles. If that's so, the simulations should be studied more deeply to enforce the training strategy in a certain direction, as this may mean that the Controller is going to crash on walls while trying to avoid other vehicles.


\subsection{Monitor Testing}

Once the Controller's runs are recorded as described previously, the Monitor testing can start.

The main goal of this phase is not only to assess the Monitor's performance when the Controller is trained: our interest is in observing evidences about which situations are \textsl{"hard"} for the Monitor, and which for the Controller. As the network becomes more expert, it may happen that its behaviour becomes such that the Monitor is no more able to detect the imminent failures, because the Controller is now good enough to cover all the failures previously covered by the Monitor, and the new hazards are such that the Monitor is not able to detect them.

However, the opposite is also a concrete possibility. For example, in the first epochs the Controller may drive in a "crazy" manner, e.g. with a lot of sudden, high-angle steerings and riding at high speed. The Monitor will obviously have more problems in predicting what the next state will be due to the unpredictability of the Controller's behaviour. The more the network learns, the more it will (hopefully) ride smoothly, making it easier for the Monitor to detect possible, imminent crashes.

The main problem that should be addressed here is that the Monitor effectiveness may decrease, while the network is learning, resulting in a useless component that may even be detrimental to the system's \textsl{performability}: the Controller may become good enough to be able to cover all the hazardous events covered by the Monitor at an earlier checkpoint. This may not change the whole safety of the system, if we consider the actions taken by the Monitor as inconditionally safe, but it would result in lesser smooth rides, due to the safety-brakes applied by the Safety Monitor.

The Monitor is tested as follows: the black boxes create during the Controller testing phase are used to \textsl{repeat} the runs. The initial conditions must be \textsl{identical} as well and should be saved as part of the black box in the previous stage. The runs of the Controller previously recorded are now repeated, attaching the Monitor to the System and recording the alarm raised and if it is able to prevent the crash that occurred.

In this stage of the analysis, the major concern was that of \textsl{non-intrusiveness}. For the reasons pointed above, we can not think about rerunning the simulations just by attaching the Safety Monitor and watch how it goes. The Safety Monitor, by definition, \textsl{overwrites} the Controller's action if an alert is raised, changing the next part of the run. This is theoretically not a problem, if one can distinguish between false and true positives. However, we can not know in advance what a false positive will be without creating a software capable of sensing an mapping the environment. But this is a Safety Monitor itself and, as every prediction tool, it will have false positives, therefore this approach can not solve the problem.

\section{BOZZA VECCHIA}

One of the main problem realated to assessing AVs' safety is the execution time. The probability of a failure increases monotonically over time, but the increasing factor should be lower the more the network is trained, so variation on the hardness of scenarios must be designed accurately. This property could result in very long simulations, but it also gives a useful hint for checking whether the system's safety is improving or not. \newline\newline
Once trained neural networks become essentially black boxes and even a small variation on the training parameters could result in totally different behaviours during test phase, therefore it can not be assumed that the same software (the monitor) will provide the same level of safety.\newline
The monitor must be tested in the same scenarios in which the controller was tested and should not intervene during the simulation, but at the rigth time needed to prevent the failure event if the controller failed the scenario. The simulations previously recorded are now repeated with the monitor activated and the following measures are extracted:

\begin{itemize}
	\item True Positive Rate (or \textsl{Sensitivity)})
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Rate of successful detections where the controller failed.
	\end{itemize}
	\item False Positive Rate (or \textsl{Fall-out})
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Rate of the events in which there's no failure but Monitor raises alarm. It is important that the fault-tolerance mechanism is not activated or the simulation will be compromised
	\end{itemize}
	\item False Negative Rate (or \textsl{Miss Rate})
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Rate of failures in the controller not detected by the monitor
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Of course we desire the monitor's detections to be the most accurate possible. For this reason \textsl{Sensitivity}\footnote{True Positive rate: the proportion of safety measures applied by the monitor when actually needed} and False Negative rate were chosen as measures of interest.\newline
While in most of the cases a false positive will result in a state of degraded service, since a self-driving car is a safety-critical system performing in a dynamic environment, a false positive could put the system in an unsafe state (imagine performing an emergency brake for no reason on the highway), so False positive rate was taken into account as well.\newline
However, these measures themselves aren't sufficient to detect changes in the interaction between the two CSs, so it's useful to record data such as the vehicle's speed and the controller's throttling/steering and to combine them with data recorded from the monitor to detect possible correlations between the behaviours.
These values must be recomputed not only when the Monitor is improved (either by implementing a more sophisticated detection method or by improving the quality of sensors) but also when the network is trained because/due to...

==============================================================================================

After collecting the data we need, performances can be easily compared to assure that the use of the same monitor with 2 different networks (or the same network in 2 different epochs) doesn't become detrimental with more expert Controllers.

\section{Experimental methodology}

In this section we propose and describe the methodology developed in this work.\newline

The study consists of several experiments in a simulated realistic environment, in which we observe how the coverage of the safety-monitor (i.e. the probability of raising an alert if there really is a safety-hazard) varies with respect to a neural network \textsl{in different stages of training}.\newline
The definition of the $n_{0}$ safety cases are the first step to perform the analysis. Each scenario should be different in terms of initial conditions for the System, but the environment should be identical. For example, given that in a situation of regular traffic the amount of cars is at most $m$, all the $n_{0}$ scenarios should spawn $m$ cars, but the initial state of the system should change (e.g. by changing the starting point). Now, after defining $h$ hardenings of the, $n_{1\dots h}$ variations of the scenarios are generate (note that here $n$ is fixed). It is important that everything else but the variation specifically designed is identical. For such reason each stage $j_{k\neq 0}$ all the parameters of the simulation should be identical to those in the stage $j_{0}$, such as \textsl{seeds} used in pseudo number generators and in general all the parameters not changed by the $k_{th}$ variation.\newline
The design and definition of the safety cases and the levels of difficulty are subjected to a lot of factors, and it is impossible to cover all the situations that may happen in a real environment. By repeating the same safety cases in worse conditions, we have a better idea of the system's ability to handle unattended situations than creating a specific safety case for the bad condition itself because in such way it's possible to study possible correlations between failures and environmental conditions.\newline\newline
\newpage


After the definition of the scenarios, the constituent systems are tested separately to get statistics about the interactions between the two, these data are then compared to those in which the Controller and the Monitor cooperate to fullfill the assigned task.\newline
The testing phase is organized in the following steps:

\begin{itemize}
	\item[1] Controller testing phase
	\item[2] Monitor testing phase
	\item[3] Data Analysis
	\item ======================================================
	\item[?] System testing phase
	\item[?] Data Analysis
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Controller Testing}


In step $1$, the controller is tested alone in the $(h+1)\cdot n$ scenarios. This testing phase was developed with the idea of comparing the results of 2 different neural networks (or again, the same neural network but in different stages of training) in mind.

In order to have a more complete picture of the networks' behaviour, in addition to the TTFs as defined above additional data are collected. This data are used to enrich the understanding of the mistakes in the control system. Examples of this data are the vehicle's speed, the controller's action (throttling, steering or braking), if there was a crash: was it with another vehicle? With a pedestrian? \newline
Since the design and especially the testing of a safety-critical system is a circular process and can not end after an acceptance test phase, informations collected in this first step can be used to guide the hardening factors in novel experiment suites.\newline
One of the most critical parameters when designing the scenarios in which the controller will be tested, is the definition of alting criteria: we don't know how long the car must drive before eventually crashing. However this problem is still unsolved and it's let to the user to define \textsl{reasonable} criteria to stop an execution. However, we think that whenever a collision is detected the scenario should be considered concluded.

========================================================================================
Credo che questa cosa sia importante. Visto che lavoriamo nell'assunzione (almeno noi) che la macchina si schianti, merita dire di trovare i parametri che rendano "abbastanza" difficile?   ----> si ricollega anche al fatto di uno goal?

========================================================================================
\newline

It is important that in this step, the \textsl{exact} behaviour is recorded for repeatability, as a sort of black box. This is because a neural network tested in two executions of the \textsl{same} scenario with the \textls{same} initial condition could take slightly different decisions that would change the rest of the environmental conditions.\newline

In

DISEGNINI PRIMA FASE

=============================================

In the second step the positives/negatives rates of the Monitor are studied. Our goal is to measure the coverage factor of this component with respect to the failures of the Controller.\newline
The \textsl{executions} of the simulations previously recorded are repetead in all the $j_{l}; \: j=1\dots n, \: l=0\dots h$ scenarios, attaching the Monitor to the system. For each scenario, the alerts raised by the Monitor are recorded but the fault-tolerance mechanism is not activated until the instant of time $z$ needed to prevent the failure event. The choice of $z$ is a sensitive issue for the accuracy of the measuresements: if the Monitor is activated too late, the failure will not be prevented and it's not possible to record just the alert raised (if any), since the efficacy of the safety procedure is an indicator of the Monitor's performance. At the same time, if the Monitor is activated too early, a premature alert will change the conditions in which the failure occurred. In this case the system may avoid the failure event, but it's impossible to say if the system was "good enough" to avoid it or if an early stopping of the car caused by a safty brake prevented it.

Using this approach, if the simulation environment and the hardware are powerful enough, it's possible to have a better understanding on which cases are easily handled by the Controller and not by the monitor, and vice versa.
Given a Controller $C_{i}$ and a Monitor $M$, we calculate the followings:

\begin{equation}
	FPR = \frac{FP}{FP+TN}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	TPR = \frac{TP}{TP+FN}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	FNR = \frac{FN}{FN+TP} = 1 - TPR
\end{equation}

As pointed before, any alert raised before time $z$ are recorded as False Positives. This allows to effectively count the number of false alarms in a given scenario, which can then be easily aggregated with the results from all the simulations to compute a good estimate of the False Positive Rate.\newline
With a good simulator it's possible to check in every frame if a crash happened and, possibly, with what the car collided. With this information, the time $t$ in which there was a crash can be easily extracted. Assuming a \textsl{proper choice} of $z$, allowing the Monitor to intervene in the time interval $t-z$ allows us to check whether the Monitor correctly detected the hazard or not.\newline
These values calculated over the sets of the $n$ scenario, for all the $h$ difficulties, are useful to understand once again what kind of situations could put the system at risk, looking at the interactions between these two components. Specifically, with this approach the coverage of the 2 constituent systems is studied in two different steps but with in the same environment(s), therefore is easier to look at similarities between failures of the controller (crashes) and failures of the Monitor (false negatives), if any.\newline\newline
It is reasonable to think about different difficulty levels $0\dots h'$ for the Safety Monitor as well. A value of $h' = 0$ may be considered as using the Monitor as it is intended to be mounted on the system. Defining $n'$ as $(h+1)\cdot n$, the number of scenarios in which the Controller was tested autonomously, the monitor is tested under $h'$ operating conditions, creating $(h' + 1) \cdot n'$. Examples of perturbations on the monitor may include downgrading of the sensors' quality or noise injection in the data collected.\newline\newline
