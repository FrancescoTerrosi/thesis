\section{Introduzione alle self-driving cars qui?}


Automotive technology has been one of the hottest topic of the decade.\newline 
With the continuously growing hardware and software technologies, completely autonomous vehicles don't seem to be unfeasible anymore: multiple sensors can retrieve high quality data from the surrounding environment and new Artificial Intelligence techniques (i.e. neural networks) are capable of working with this data in a manner that outclasses classical statistical models. However, the use of AI to drive cars, requires more focus on safety and the way to assess it.\newline
Autonomous vehicles can be classified in five levels of autonomy:

\begin{itemize}
	\item[Level 0 -] No Automation
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[$\rightarrow$] The human driver performs all the tasks, such as steering, accelerating, braking\dots Cars with \textsl{forward collision warning systems} and \textsl{lane keep assist} fall in this category
	\end{itemize}
	\item[Level 1 -] Driver Assistance
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[$\rightarrow$] The vehicle assists the human driver in relatively simple tasks (e.g. adaptive cruise control)
	\end{itemize}
	\item[Level 2 -] Partial Automation
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[$\rightarrow$] At this level the vehicle is capable of performing more complex tasks (e.g. \textsl{Parking assistance, Tesla's Autopilot}) but the driver still must be able to correct unexpected behaviours of the car.
	\end{itemize}
	\item[Level 3 -] Conditional Automation
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[$\rightarrow$ ] Level three automation means that the vehicle is now in full control under specific conditions (e.g. riding on a highway). However the human driver still must be able to intervene when requested by the system to do so
	\end{itemize}
	\item[Level 4 -] High Automation
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[$\rightarrow$] At this level the vehicle can drive completely autonomously, \textsl{without} any kind of human interaction. However, they are subjected to specific conditions and assumptions that, when not fulfilled, may result in unexpected behaviours (or catastrophic failures!)
	\end{itemize}
	\item[Level 5 -] Complete Automation
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[$\rightarrow$] True driverless cars. Human intervention is not needed at all and the car can operate in every condition and environment.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
