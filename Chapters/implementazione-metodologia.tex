\chapter{Method Implementation And Results}

In this chapter the tools used, the software infrastructure and method implementation and the results collected during the analysis are reviewed.

A DDPG Agent\footnote{An agent whose actions are taken by a neural network trained with the reinforcement learning algorithm DDPG} was trained to drive in an urban environment. Checkpoints of the network's state during the training were recorded for the purpose of comparison. These checkpoints of the network were then tested with and without a simple safety-monitor in order to provide a new point of view to study AV's behaviours.

\section{Tools and software}

\subsection{Carla Simulator}

In order to have a realistic environment, with accurate physics simulation and data sensors, the open-source simulator CARLA\cite{carla}, developed by researchers at the University of Barcelona, was used. This simulator was developed with the purpose of offering an environment where AI agents can be trained to drive, with high control of the simulation parameters and the simulation of realistic sensor, which can be tuned to increase or decrease data quality, or to inject faults.\newline
CARLA is developed with a client-server architecture in mind. The \textsl{server} is basically a game, developed with \textsl{Unreal Engine 4} in C++. C++ performances are with no doubt essential to the functionality of the server: not only the environment must be simulated (including movements of pedestrians/vehicles, weather simulation\dots), but also all the data needed from the sensors attached to the system.\newline

IMMAGINE CARLA

======================================================================================

CARLA is currently at version 0.9.7 and huge improvements are done at every release, gaining more attention from the experts for its realism. Unfortunately, when this study started, CARLA 0.9 was recently released and the tools needed for our work couldn't be found online. Thanks to the quantity of work done for the last \textit{stable} version of CARLA, 0.8.4 was used at first.\newline
Versions prior to 0.9 have some limitations on the control one has of the simulations parameters and on the data collectable from it. This doesn't impede our study, but of course limited in some way the informations on the environment and system. Some of these problems are still present in later versions of the simulator, but most of them were solved in the transition from 0.8 to 0.9.\newline\newline
One of the main problems found was with the coordinate systems. Before version 0.9, developers were using UE4's default coordinates system which is left-handed, while the standard is considered to be right-handed. This looks like not a big deal since things could be easily solved by applying a transformation matrix. However, due to performance issues (a Python client should do the real-time processing of \textsl{loads} of data at each timestep, resulting in considerable slowdowns as a result of all the processes running at the same time), it was decided to stick with the developers' decision and convert the data during analysis phase.

Unfortunately, this version of CARLA has only 4 sensors available, which were all used during the experiments. They can be easily accessed via the Python APIs provided:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Cameras
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The \textsl{scene final} camera provides a view of the scene (just like a regular camera)
		\item The \textsl{depth map} camera assigns RGB values to objects to perceive \textsl{depth} of the environment
		\item A \textsl{semantic segmentation} is used to classify different objects in the view by displaying them in different colors, according to the object's class
	\end{itemize}
	\item Ray-cast based Lidar
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Light Detection and Ranging is use to sense the environment and measures distance from objects by illunating the target with laser beams and measuring the time reflected light needs to "go back" to the sensor
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The three cameras were used during the training phase of the network. Three \textsl{scene final} cameras are attached to the car to actually \textsl{see} the environment (one on the front and one per side). The \textsl{depth map} camera allows the car to get a colormap of the distances from objects in the scenario.
The \textsl{semantic segmentation} provides image classification features by querying the server for ground-truth values. This is with no doubt a semplification of a real system, where the most powerful image-classification softwares are essentially other neural networks trained separately. At the same time a misclassification can be considered as an error of the control system: if the safety monitor detects the possible hazard it will not "correct" the misclassification but it must react fast and safely to avoid the possible consequences of it, therefore this simplification won't have an impact on the overall method.\newline

A ray-cast based Lidar is the only other sensor available for this version of CARLA. Parameters of this sensor can be easily tuned to simulate real lidars such as the \textsl{Velodyne LiDAR} or to simulate faults such as low data quality, noisy data or data loss\dots

In the simulations, due to the high hardware resources requirements to simulate a real LiDAR, a slightly modified version of the \textsl{Velodyne64 LiDAR} is implemented with the following parameters:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Channels = 64
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The number of laser beams used by the system. These lasers are distributed over the vertical axis. The more the lasers are, the more accurate will be the scannings
	\end{itemize}
	\item Range = 75m
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Lasers' range in meters
	\end{itemize}
	\item Rotation Frequency = 15 Hz
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This parameters define the rotation frequency (in Hz) of the scanning beams.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Points Per Second = 1.000.000
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The actual number of points generated each frame by the sensor
	\end{itemize}
	\item Vertical FOV bounds (height = 24m, low = -2m. Distances are relative to the position of the sensor)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Maximum and minimum height of the scannings
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The simulator provides Python APIs not only to modify sensors, but also to have a great control on what is being simulated, such as seeds definition for the spawning points and the behaviours of pedestrians and vehicles, and on the state of \textsl{"actors"} in the scene such as their position, their speed\dots. All these data are directly provided by the simulator with ground-truth values. These kind of measurements can be simulation-related, such as the simulation time-step, or the FPS. Actors-related measurements include for example vehicles' speed, intensity of collisions (if any) and the 3D acceleration vector.\newline

While this tool was being tested a problem was found with the LiDAR sensor data that is still not resolved.\cite{lidarbug} 
The bug resulted in the vehicles' bounding boxes to be distorted when moving, providing very poor data.
After some research an improved version of the simulator was found, where the bounding boxes for each vehicle were redefined to provide accurate data.\cite{carlapro} As of today, developers are working on this issue but it is still unresolved without manual intervention on the source code.


\subsection{Controller Implementation}

The main component needed for the Controller implementation is the neural network that will be in charge of deciding the action to perform to drive the car. We looked for a framework with the following characteristics

\begin{itemize}
	\item[1] Training code must be available
	\item[2] No critical issues in the codebase
	\item[3] Provide an environment to interface the network with CARLA
\end{itemize}

After analyzing all the machine-learning related projects for CARLA, we chose the reinforcement-learning framework \textsl{Coach}, developed by\textsl{Intel AI Lab}.\cite{coach}
